A Gantt chart, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against. A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, named after its inventor, Henry Gantt (1861–1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910–1915. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency relationships between activities and current schedule status.

(Industrial Relations & HR Terms) a chart showing, in horizontal lines, activity planned to take place during specified periods, which are indicated in vertical bands. A Gantt chart is a tool for project management developed originally by Henry Gantt in the early 1900s. It is a type of bar chart that shows the start and end times for each task in a project schedule.

I'm an amateur at this stuff - just really need some knowledge of project management to work with clients. I've read around the place that Gantt charts aren't considered the best way to project and monitor a project tasks and milestones over time any more. I just don't know what the new thing is. What would you recommend? amp#x200B. Gantt project planner. Use this accessible project planner to track your project by unique activities using the Gantt chart model. Easily see where each activity is according I'm working on projects with a few different teams as a freelancer. I've seen some people use Gantt charts fashioned out of Google Sheets and it's pretty primitive seeming to me - you can't easily move things around if something changes, there's no assigning of tasks etc - it's just not interactive or elegant at all. So i'm on the hunt for something that will work well for the long haul. I use Trello for my own workflow and I like it well enough - especially because of the simplicity.

I'm creating a gantt chart using the stacked bar chart methods: I have the tasks in one column, the start date (dd/mm/yyyy), duration in days, end date. I cannot for the death of me get Excel to format the axis with the major unit of a year. 2016, 2017, etc. It throws up completely irrelevant dates which make the reading of the chart a pain. I just cannot figure out how to fix it. I tried with a helper column of 0s but it just did not work. Any suggestions would be welcome. Hi! Can someone please help me change the "period" to actual dates? From what I can see this will also mean some conditional formatting changes which I can't seem to figure out.

Hi new manager, trying to get a small team organized by planning out the year ahead. What is a free or cheap Gantt chart app for Mac or online tool? If I have to pay I will but really need to learn first. Thank. 22 weeks pregnant with my second little one and I got through writing my dissertation in 5 weeks, presented at a conference a week prior to my oral defense and submitted a post doc fellowship application the day of my defense. woohoo it’s all done!!!! I can finally sleep and watch movies!!!!! First PhD in my family and have worked hard to reduce my public speaking anxiety! Also first-gen from low income family and lovely Mexican parents. I did it! Edit: Wait i just realized I don’t even know where to begin. I have 30 people on 3 teams, going to 14 difference countries. I’ve been asked to create a Gantt chart showing what team will be where to ensure we aren’t being spread too thin. Has anyone done this sort of thing before. Hi all, I just finished my BS in construction management online. I started out in the field doing renovations and remodeling for a construction company then moved into the office pretty quick. The one thing that disappointed me a bit though is that my office does everything in Excel including the Gantt Charts. I've only done a few projects in MS project while in school and have some familiarity with it but for the most part I've just been working with Excel. When applying for bigger firms Most of my professional experience was from being a Jr-Ssr backend developer in companies where I was rather a passive employee that solves problems determined by my superiors. But I really want to become more independent, because I want to be able to create an income regardless of how job interviews work out and also a personal one (\ ) What did you need to learn aside coding? Can I work as a freelance doing only Backend? Or do I need to become a Full Stack Hello, i'm trying to find self-hosted open source resource planner, but 0 success. I just want float ( like interface (it can even be ugly), but nobody offers anything like that. Does anyone know something. 
What online project management tools do you use and does it solve most (or all) of your problems? Asana, Monday, Airtable, etc. I can't seem to find a suitable solution as a PM. 1 - I need a tool I will use myself as the PM, this is my domain and the value I bring to a project. I don't expect architects, web developers, designers, support staff, etc to have to log into my tool of choice to provide (and in some cases duplicate) status updates. 2- I need a gantt chart that works based I am looking to make a Gantt Chart that dynamically changes based on the inputs. I want to be able to show the dates chronologically arranged from an input column and have them transposed to the X Axis of the Gantt Chart chronologically arranged. Using these inputs, they should fill up the cells in between them. On the other hand, is there a way to create dependencies for certain items and show them in the Gantt Chart. Looking for Gantt chart program. I manage about 60 construction projects, material controls. I want Gantt chart that I can show all the projects going on. Also when I put start to end date, it automatically set alarm about 6 weeks before project starts, reminds me to check item a, b c and so on. Also middle of project, it kicks another alarm to check progress etc. Possibly i can filter by jobs by type of materials being. One of the major things a lot of people have said for them is splitting off from a main bus. However, if you're doing e.g. four splits from a four-lane bus, it seems to be more expensive than prebalancing followed by splitting each lane; the balancer costs six splitters, followed by four splitters (one per split) for a cost of ten splitters, while using splitter cascades would result in four groups of four splitters, for a total cost of 16 splitters (60% more). So, splitting off is more expensi. This all sounds pretty obvious, but I try to remind myself of it daily. So I thought I'd share: A project isn't done when your work is done. A project is done when you've gotten paid for it. Something to always keep in mind. And try to keep reminding your clients of that fact, of course in civil ways. If you're making a work timeline, after the row where you add the date for your final deliverables, add another row for the due date for final payment. Remind them of your payment schedule. Hi, I am looking for a way for keeping track of tasks, notes and deadlines on different projects, but I found that getting all that mixed up with regular tasks on my monthly and daily logs is pretty confusing and out or order. What would you suggest in order to achieve this? An indexed collection for every project (this would be like a bujo inside a bujo, bujinception). 
Hello all, I have noticed that a lot of people come to this sub for help because they are confused about the relationships between Tolkien's various works. What are the Great Tales? How do they relate to the Silmarillion? Is Beren and Luthien a complete novel? Etc. Given the frequency of questions like this, I designed this chart to help clarify the narrative overlap between Tolkien's published works in a simple, visually pleasing way. Hopefully some people will find it helpful or, for those. </p>
