                            <p> I'm looking to see if someone can help clarify a really simple script I'm trying to write. Basically, if both left and right mouse buttons are pressed, I'd like the left alt key pressed, and if only the left mouse button is pressed, I'd like the left alt button pressed. amp#x200B; Here is what I have written. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; if IsMouseButtonPressed(1)then if IsMouseButtonPressed(2) then repeat PressAndReleaseKey(lalt) until not IsMouseButtonPressed(1). Hi, I'm posting this here since I felt this is something that is more gear specific, not so much game or other utility specific. BACKGROUND, PRODUCTS: I got the CH products Fighterstick, CH Pro Pedals and the CH Pro Throttle to fly in Elite Dangerous and was very satisfied with them. I bought them used but they still feel very solid and I have not had any issues with them. (The problem with Windows 10 and the CH manager not allowing you to set it for direct mode or mapped mode or respond. Hello, I've been working through the Libtcod + Python 3 tutorial at ( and I can't figure out how to get full screen toggling to work. I'm using a Mac and I've gotten to Part 6 with no other issues but I keep coming back to the full screen issue and haven't yet been able to figure out what's wrong. Every time I use the hotkeys to toggle full screen it just closes the console window where the game is displayed. Has anyone So I can't seem to figure something out. I just finished part 11 of the roguelike tutorial, where you insert the number pad controls. For some reason when I use the numpad monsters take two turns. When I use the arrow pad monsters still take one turn (as they are supposed to). here is the code for handle keys : def handle_keys(): global key; if key.vk == libtcod.KEY_ENTER and key.lalt: #Alt+Enter: toggle fullscreen libtcod. 
So I've been following this( ) tutorial for a while, and to learn more, I change small things, like controls, tweaking the stats etc. I'm accustomed to using 'wasd' as movement keys, but in the tutorial, the ones that are used are arrow keys. I tried to use the documentation to help with it. It actually worked, but not smoothly like when I was using arrow keys. If I pressed and didn't release the arrow. Hi, for some reason my inputs are no longer working for libtcodpy. They were working, but after adding in FOV, the inputs no longer work, and I didn't delete anything from the function while adding FOV. Here's the function: def handleInput(): global playerX, playerY if libtcod.console_is_key_pressed(libtcod.KEY_UP): if not map.tiles player.x player.y - 1 blocked: player.move(0, -1) isRecompute = True elif libtcod.console_is_key_pressed(libtcod. I just finished configuring Raptor: Call of the Shadows, the awesome shoot-em-up from 1994, on RetroPie using the 8bitdo SN30. There were some little quirks in the setup process so I thought I'd put something together in case anyone else wants to do the same. It's long-winded, but it will hopefully be useful to someone. # Install First thing to do is to make sure DOSBox is installed, as it's an optional package. That can be done in RetroPie config, `Manage packages` -gt `opt` -gt `dosbox`. People have been complaining a lot about how F10, F11, and F12 are the keys to enable/disable aerodynamics and heat indication, specifically because F12 is the default Steam screenshot key. I've found that F6-F8 are much better keys. LAlt + F12 is already the debug menu and F12 is the screenshot key; F1-F4 do various things (internal screenshots, ship labels, etc) but between F5 (quick save) and F9 (quick load), there are 3 convenient keys in the middle of the keyboard that are just right. 
I'm running Mac OS 10.12.6 and have a Logitech G13 that I am trying to program for Photoshop use. Very frustrating that it doesn't have the ability to assign basic command keys/spacebar and allow you to hold them down while working, since that's a big part of Photoshop use. I've written the following script in the script editor in order to try and get around this: function OnEvent(event, arg) OutputLogMessage("event = %s, arg = %s\n", event, arg) if (event == "G_PRESSED" #IfWinExist ahk_class Spotify ;Spotify global keys LAlt amp Down::Send Media_Play_Pause ;Send, {Media_Play_Pause} Browser_Back::Media_Prev Browser_Forward::Media_Next Return Can the #IfWinExist just be hanging out the script like this, or should it be after my hotkeys individually? Within a function? Thanks in advance. ## The Helidox (CRKBD) Group Buy is now live! Go to https://keyhive.xyz/shop to pick up a kit!

For DS2 I used an AHK script, bound to what I wanted and it fixed the input lag as well as worked immaculately inside and outside of PvP. Is there any way I can have an AHK script for DS3, considering that I can't bind left hand usage to a single key (has to be shift, ctrl, alt and a click) and Weapon Arts are very hard to perform? Here was my DS2 autohotkey script if it helps at all: #SingleInstance Force #MaxHotkeysPerInterval 99999 #IfWinActive ahk_class DarkSouls2 ; Hold to block Hey guys, I decided to try out Colemak and settled on Colemak with the curl/angle/wide mods (the wide mod in particular is important) with the Extend layer. I'm on Win 10, ANSI keyboard, and downloaded the PKL version. Although there are a lot of comments in the ini files, I'm still not entirely sure how to configure or customize the layout to my needs. For one, I wanted to move the Extend button (Caps Lock) by default to my Left Alt key, since using my left pinky didn't seem particularly. I built her, liked her, put in some forma’s but have one minor issue. Regularly I’m struggling to try and get the invis buff. I try slow methodical crouching and spamming the crouch button like a madman but whatever I do, it seems to only works fast about 50% of the time. Do any of you have any advice about how to setup the song so I can make it easier to get the invis buff instantly. Hey everyone. I've seen a few people frustrated with not being able to bind the LAlt key, and I've found out how to do it via config file. The config file in questions is ProfileOptions_Profile (open with notepad or similar) and it's located here: %userprofile%\Documents\BioWare\AnthemDemo\settings I used this site to find the button numbers being used in the config. Make a backup of this file so you can restore if something Couple of minutes ago all my keyboard combinations stopped working. After some checking it turned out that my Mod4 and L\_ALT keys have swapped places. This is not an OS issue as my other keyboard sends them correctly. Reflashing didn't fix it either. Is there some key combination I'm not aware of that can swap some buttons around or is this likely to be some hardware annoyance? I'm using rev.5 Planck and the buttons in question are right next to each other on the bottom row. Nothing else seems. 
Got my Samsung Chromebook the other day and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it and then pretty quickly switched to XFCE because Unity was kind of slow on it. So my biggest issue has been making the keyboard not terrible (no home/end keys = me sad). Possibly there is a better way of doing this, but after banging my head against the wall for a while I found that someone had already solved this issue for users of Crouton by creating a custom keyboardset. The original script is here (https://github.com/. I currently use the “tilde” or “left tick” or “grave key” button for push to talk, which i believe is standard for overwatch pc. However, i find this to be very inconvenient to press in game, but dont want to push to talk, so i most often end up just not talking in teamfights, which is obviously detrimental to the team. My question is: what buttons/arrangements do you guys use for push to talk? Note: I already use mouse four and five for other functions. I simply wanted to rebind Alt + Q to Numpad 7 here is my code: !q::Numpad7 It works fine with the Right Alt key + Q, but the Left one does not which is the one i need. I tried to specifically bind the left one like this: lt!q::Numpad7 But this does not work at all. I'm at a loss i have no idea why this doesn't work. I looked in the Key History and the Alt keys show up as LAlt and RAlt. EDIT: Fixed it by using !q::SendEvent {Numpad7}. Basically what the title says. Binding crouch to Lalt makes it a lot easier to AD crouch or just spam it in general. You should try it out for yourself. Hey guys! Just got my first programmable keyboard and just wondering. Is it possible to create a keycombination which allows swapping GUI and LALT key without reflashing the firmware? This would be much needed since i swap between OSX, linux and windows back and forth. Regards,'. I'm trying to figure out how to insert AltGr codes on a 60% keyboard. Both my Nerd60 and KC60 run QMK, same layout with right/left alt's set as standard. On a typically full-sized keyboard it would require you to press right alt (AltGr) + number-pad keycode combination. However as I do not have a number-pad, do I need to change my 1-2.9-0 keys to their number-pad replacements or is there some wizardry I am missing? Thanks. :-) Backstory, going to be learning Swedish need alternative alphabet. Hey guys. It has happened to me several times, being today the last and one of the most obnoxious making me lose over 1,5 hour of flight time for the logbook, 3 a2a kills , not beign killed by the 120s and an aerial refueling. Looks like my brain loves to hit Lshift+R instead of Lshift+F to deploy flaps when landing after a long, difficult and rewarding mission. I have tried to remap that Restart Mission function to anything else more difficult to hit by accident, I have remapped This page is a complete list of key notations for AutoHotkey.
