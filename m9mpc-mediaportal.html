After the release of MediaPortal 2.2 Final the team focussed on improving usability and extending functionalities besides fixing. I’m looking for some advice on replacing Windows Media Center with Kodi for my parents. For some backstory I built them a HTPC running Windows Media Center around 10 years ago, which they love. amp#x200B; Obviously Windows Media Center is long since discontinued, however even today still works well as a DVR with the exception of having to run a script to manually download guide data OTA, as Microsoft no longer provide it. amp#x200B; WMC integrated with Plex and TotalMedia Theatre Download MediaPortal 2.2  Turn your PC into a true multimedia center.

Hey everyone. I work for a Home Theater company outside of Atlanta and need some advice on a big project. I've been building gaming PCs for the last 8 years, and have the opportunity to work on something bigger. (Apologies for the long post, I just want to give everyone a complete picture of what I'm trying to do and my findings thus far:) I have a client who is wanting to take his 500 some-odd DVD movie collection and have us digitize it and set up a home media server. I am planning MediaPortal is a free open source media center software, ideal for turning your PC into a very advanced multi media center, or Home Theater PC (HTPC). Using MediaPortal, you can listen to your favorite music and radio; watch your videos and DVDs; or view, schedule and record live TV, much like a digital video recorder such as TiVo, but better. For as much as we all love college football, unfortunately the season will be over and the offseason will begin in January. If anyone finds a link to full replays of games this year, please post them here. It will be nice to comeback and rewatch games of teams we may have missed when they happened. Performance! Unlike many other Media Center programs, MediaPortal was designed especially for Microsoft Windows. Thus, the performance and playback quality is unsurpassed. Hi ​ I'm thinking about getting some, would be keen on Shelly 1 as well but it seems to of sold out. If you'd like a few and you are in New Zealand you can pre-purchase some from me to save money.

I am wanting to build a decent HTPC for ages already and in the past experimented although the machine was ancient, running on an AMD 64 3500+ :) with 1GB of memory, lol. (My oldest box here, amazed it was actually still running.the case from that time where PC cases were still beige :) I finally upgraded this box, now it has a decent board (Gigabyte GA-B75M) with i5 3470S, 8GB. Very nice, low power at idle, ideal for a HTPC imho. (I got the board, CPU, memory and a cooler for a nice €130. Kodi 17.6 'Krypton' MediaPortal BackEnd TVServer with kodi add-on. TV Works, Save Works, EPG works. Cannot get Time Shift to work. I currently use ffmpeg as the streaming method as when I use TSReader kodi never finds the stream and effectively lock up as the 'connecting' pop-up never closes as the stream is not found. Some help and advice on configuration would be helpful. Thanks Mighty. Kodi 17.4 Krypton MediaPortal Backend for the TV Card amp MediaPortal addon for Kodi. EPG works fine and updates regularly. I can't get record or Pause to work for the TV Stream either, even though both MP amp Kodi point to the folder locations. However the main problem is the live stream freezes. Just stops - audio disappears and screen freezes. Controls work normally, so stopping the playback and restarting restores the stream. You just miss the 90 seconds or so lost in restarting. 
So, I am currently running Kodi 17.2, with Mediaportal as the TV server for Pvr functions. This is all on a standalone win 10 htpc. All works well, but for some reason, it keeps defaulting to the narrated audio stream when watching tv. I've tried changing it and making the English stream the default, but it keeps reverting back to narrated. Does anyone else have the same issue? Anyone have any ideas I have been using PLEX for a while now. However, I also am aware of other streaming programs including KODI and MediaPortal. I understand the main options all have pros and cons and I have come across some comparison charts online. If anyone here has tried all three of these programs, can you please provide a brief breakdown of the three? Also, please add more programs to the list if there are others I should seriously consider when choosing the program I am going to go with. I know some program. This is a problem that occurred after I upgraded to Kodi 'Jarvis' in January this year during a system OS rebuild (previously used XBMC and lower version of Kodi) - although the set-up is the same I now get a pop-up from the PVR Manager ( PVR Manager is Stating Up No PVR Clients have been started yet. Wait for the PVR Clients to Start Up. Check log for more info about this message) and if I don't hit the cancel button on the pop-up soon enough, Kodi crashes - and crashes so badly Hi All. Quick question. I've been evaluating JRvier for a HTPC environment I have and must say that coming from XBMC it's audio surpasses XBMC as far as quality and clarity is concerned. I've been reading about, and not yet tried, MediaPortal and was wondering if it would come close to JRiver where Audio playback is concerned. To me (and my setup) playing something through, say, VLC and then JRvier, the difference is night and day. I know with MediaPortal you could tweak Video optimisation. I currently have WMC on Windows 8.1. What's the best alternative in terms of UI, and ease of use when I do install Windows 10? I only use WMC for free OTA TV. Also, an option to stream to mobile devices e.g Android or Windows tablet would be awesome. Does anyone know if it’s going to be posted online or anything? Please. Hey - In the Titan Skin Configuration tool it looks like I should be able to rename menus. i.e. I have the OnlineVideos plugin as a main menu item that I just use for Netflix and would like to rename it 'Netflix'. Similarly the MPsteam plugin I want to rename 'Steam'. I can type in these name and save my changes by when I run MP the names have not changed. I have also tried editing the strings_en.xml file (ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\language) but this makes no difference. Just got a popup saying that Netflix will no longer be available in WMC after September 15. WMC has worked well for our needs, but I guess it is finally Hi, struggling to setup TV in mediaportal and was wondering if anyone here had an idea on how to set it up. I've scanned and added channels in the "Mediaportal 2 SetupTV" application but have no idea how to access them. When opening the mediaportal 2 app and selecting TV, the channels appear but when I click on them it says "No media item." TV works fine using the woeful "winfast PVR2' software, and the model of the card is a Winfast DTV2000DS Plus. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks. 
With a Sony Vaio amp Denon 1612, when I have the speaker configuration in Windows set to 5.1, the Denon plays DD/DTS files correctly, but plays stereo files with only the L/R because the PC is sending the other 3 channels as empty. If I switch the speaker setup in Windows to stereo, the Denon plays all files as stereo through the Pro Logic. Of course, I want it to switch automatically, playing DD/DTS natively and playing stereo files through Pro Logic. To try to accomplish this, I set Media.
